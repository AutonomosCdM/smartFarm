---

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Architecture Design

**Backup Strategy:**
- Multi-tier retention (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Isolated restore testing (no production impact)
- Dual storage (local + S3 optional)
- Integrated monitoring (SNS + CloudWatch)

**Components:**
1. **Automated Backup Script** (`automate-backups.sh`)
   - Backs up Open WebUI and Redis volumes
   - Implements retention policy
   - Uploads to S3 (optional)
   - Sends status alerts

2. **Restore Script** (`restore-from-backup.sh`)
   - Interactive restore from local/S3
   - Metadata display
   - Automatic verification

3. **Restore Test Script** (`test-restore.sh`)
   - Weekly automated testing
   - 6-step verification process
   - Isolated test volumes
   - Integrity checks

4. **S3 Setup Script** (`setup-s3-backups.sh`)
   - Bucket creation with encryption
   - Lifecycle policies for cost optimization
   - Security hardening

5. **Installation Script** (`install-backup-automation.sh`)
   - One-command setup
   - Cron job configuration
   - Environment setup

### 2. Technical Implementation

**Backup Process Flow:**
```
1. Docker volume backup (Open WebUI + Redis)
2. Metadata generation (timestamp, versions, server info)
3. Compression (tar.gz)
4. Storage classification (daily/weekly/monthly)
5. S3 upload (if enabled)
6. Retention policy enforcement
7. SNS notification
```

**Retention Logic:**
- Daily backups: Last 7 days
- Weekly backups: Sundays only, last 4 weeks
- Monthly backups: 1st of month only, last 6 months
- Automatic cleanup of older backups

**Restore Testing:**
- Extracts backup to temporary location
- Verifies all components present
- Restores to isolated test volumes
- Checks SQLite database integrity
- Validates backup size
- Cleanup test resources

- Backup size: ~500MB per backup
- Daily: 500MB × 7 = 3.5GB
- Weekly: 500MB × 4 = 2GB
- Monthly: 500MB × 6 = 3GB
- **Total: 8.5GB**

**Instance Storage:**
- Current: 2GB Lightsail instance
- Backup location: Separate volume (if needed)
- Cost: $0/month ✓

**Pros:**
- Zero cost
- Fast backup/restore
- No external dependencies

**Cons:**
- Single point of failure
- No disaster recovery if server lost

### S3 Offsite Backups (~$0.25/month)

**Detailed Cost Breakdown:**

| **Storage** | |
| Daily (Standard, 7 days) | 3.5GB × $0.023 = $0.08 |
| Weekly (Standard-IA, 23 days) | 2GB × $0.0125 = $0.03 |
| Monthly (Glacier IR, 60 days) | 3GB × $0.004 = $0.01 |
| **Requests** | |
| PUT (daily uploads) | ~30 × $0.005/1000 = $0.01 |
| **Data Transfer** | |
| Upload (to S3) | $0 (free inbound) |
| Download (restore) | Only when needed |
| **Total Monthly Cost** | **$0.13/month** |

**With lifecycle transitions:**
- Day 0-7: Standard storage
- Day 7-30: Standard-IA (50% cheaper)
- Day 30-90: Glacier Instant (83% cheaper)
- Day 90+: Deep Archive (95% cheaper)

**Annual cost:** $1.56/year ✓ Well under $24 budget

**Pros:**
- Offsite redundancy
- Disaster recovery capability
- Automatic lifecycle management

- Extremely low cost

**Cons:**
- Requires AWS credentials
- Slight complexity increase
- Restore from S3 slower (but still < 10 min)

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Lifecycle Policies** (implemented)
   - Automatic transition to cheaper storage classes
   - Saves ~70% on storage costs

2. **Retention Tuning**
   - Current: 7 daily, 4 weekly, 6 monthly
   - Can reduce if storage becomes an issue
   - Configurable via script variables

3. **Compression**
   - Already using tar.gz (10:1 ratio typical)
   - Further optimization possible with xz (slower)

4. **Selective Backup**
   - Currently backs up full volumes
   - Could implement incremental backups (future)

## Integration with Existing Systems

### CloudWatch Monitoring

**Backup-related CloudWatch Alarms:**
- Disk usage >85% (proactive warning)
- Disk usage >95% (critical, may prevent backups)
- Memory pressure (could affect backup performance)

**Integration:**
- Backup script checks disk space before running
- Alerts via SNS if disk usage critical
- Automatic retention policy prevents disk fill

**See:** `docs/CLOUDWATCH_MONITORING.md`

### SNS Alerting

**Topic:** `arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:586794472237:smartfarm-alerts`

**Notification Types:**
1. **Backup Success** (daily)
   - Backup type (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - File size
   - Retention summary
   - Disk usage

2. **Backup Failure** (immediate)
   - Error details
   - Failed component
   - Recommended action

3. **Restore Test Results** (weekly)
   - All tests passed/failed
   - Backup integrity status
   - Test details

4. **Warnings**
   - High disk usage (>90%)
   - S3 upload failed (backup saved locally)
   - Backup size anomaly

**Email Recipients:**
- admin@autonomos.dev (primary)
- Additional subscribers (configurable)

### CI/CD Pipeline

**Backup automation does NOT interfere with:**
- GitHub Actions deployments
- Automated updates
- Container restarts

**Backup timing:**
- 2 AM UTC: Daily backup (off-peak)
- 3 AM UTC: Weekly restore test (Sundays)
- CI/CD deploys: Any time (no conflict)

---

## Security Considerations

### Backup Encryption

**At Rest:**
- **Local:** File system level (if configured)
- **S3:** AES256 server-side encryption (mandatory)

**In Transit:**
- **S3 uploads:** HTTPS only (enforced by bucket policy)
- **Local transfers:** Within same server (no network)

### Access Control

**Backup Files:**
- Owner: root
- Permissions: 644 (read-only for non-root)
- Location: `/opt/smartfarm/backups/` (protected)

**S3 Bucket:**
- Public access: Blocked (all methods)
- IAM: Least privilege (PutObject, GetObject, ListBucket only)
- Versioning: Enabled (protection against deletion)
- Bucket policy: Denies unencrypted uploads, HTTP access

### Sensitive Data

**Backup Contents:**
- SQLite database (user data, chat history)
- Configuration files (.env excluded)
- Uploaded files (user documents)
- Redis cache (sessions, temporary data)

**Security Measures:**
1. Root-only access to backups
2. Encrypted S3 storage
3. Secure transmission (HTTPS)
4. Audit logging (all operations logged)
5. No secrets in backups (.env gitignored)

### Compliance

**Data Protection:**
- Backups stored in us-east-1 (Virginia)
- No cross-region transfers
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access logging enabled

**Retention:**
- Automatic deletion after retention period
- No manual intervention required
- Audit trail in CloudWatch Logs

---
