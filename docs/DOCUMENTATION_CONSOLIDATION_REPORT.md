## Problem Statement

### Issues Identified

**1. CI/CD Documentation Fragmentation:**
- `CICD_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Basic deployment guide
- `CICD_OPTIMIZATION.md` - Performance tuning
- `CICD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Problem solving
- **Problem:** Information scattered across 3 files, redundancy ~40%

**2. SSH Security Documentation Duplication:**
- `SSH_HARDENING_REFERENCE.md` - Command reference
- `SSH_HARDENING_REPORT.md` - Implementation report
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SSH_SECURITY.md` - CI/CD SSH security
- `SECURITY_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference card
- **Problem:** 4 files covering same topic, redundancy ~60%

**3. Outdated Files in Active Docs:**
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SSH_INVESTIGATION.md` - Historical investigation (problem solved)
- `PHASE_3_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` - Project milestone (no longer needed in active docs)
- **Problem:** Cluttering active documentation with archived content

**4. Backup Documentation in Wrong Location:**
- 4 backup automation files in archive/ directory
- **Problem:** Confusing organization (implementation docs in archive)

**5. Inconsistent Internal Links:**
- Broken links to archived files
- Absolute paths instead of relative
- References to renamed files
- **Problem:** Navigation broken, maintenance difficult
