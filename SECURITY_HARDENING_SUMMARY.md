# SmartFarm SSH Security Hardening - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Server:** 98.87.30.163 (AWS Lightsail)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Production Ready

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive SSH security hardening for SmartFarm production server. The server is now protected by multiple layers of security and is ready for port 22 to be opened to 0.0.0.0/0 for GitHub Actions CI/CD deployment.

### What Was Implemented

1. ✅ **fail2ban intrusion prevention** - Active and already blocking malicious IPs
2. ✅ **SSH hardening** - Strict authentication policies, strong cryptography
3. ✅ **CloudWatch monitoring** - Real-time log streaming and metrics
4. ✅ **Security dashboard** - Automated status checking script

### Security Posture

- **Current Threat Level:** LOW
- **fail2ban Status:** Active (1 IP already banned)
- **SSH Configuration:** Hardened (password auth disabled, root login disabled)
- **Monitoring:** Active (CloudWatch streaming logs)
- **Ready for Production:** YES ✅

---

## Detailed Implementation

### 1. fail2ban Intrusion Prevention

**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE

**Configuration:**
- Ban duration: 1 hour
- Find time: 10 minutes
- Max retries: 3 attempts

**Current Activity:**
- Currently failed attempts: 5
- Currently banned IPs: 1 (103.186.1.120)
- Total failed attempts: 11
- Total banned IPs: 1

**Effectiveness:**
- fail2ban is actively detecting and blocking SSH brute force attempts
- Malicious IP from 103.186.1.120 banned after 3+ failed attempts

**Files:**
- Configuration: `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`
- Logs: `/var/log/fail2ban.log` (also streamed to CloudWatch)

### 2. SSH Hardening

**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE

**Applied Configurations:**

| Setting | Value | Security Benefit |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| PasswordAuthentication | no | Prevents brute force attacks |
| PermitRootLogin | no | Prevents root compromise |
| PubkeyAuthentication | yes | Strong key-based auth only |
| MaxAuthTries | 3 | Limits brute force attempts |
| LoginGraceTime | 60s | Reduces attack window |
| MaxStartups | 10:30:60 | Connection rate limiting |
| LogLevel | VERBOSE | Detailed security logging |

**Cryptography:**
- Strong ciphers: chacha20-poly1305, aes256-gcm
- Strong MACs: hmac-sha2-512-etm
- Modern key exchange: curve25519-sha256

**Files:**
- Configuration: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/99-smartfarm-hardening.conf`
- Backup: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup.20251019_*`

### 3. CloudWatch Monitoring

**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE

**Agent Details:**
- Version: 1.300060.0b1248
- Status: Running
- Started: 2025-10-19T13:15:39+00:00

**Log Streams:**

| Log Group | Source File | Retention |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| /aws/ec2/smartfarm/ssh | /var/log/auth.log | 7 days |
| /aws/ec2/smartfarm/fail2ban | /var/log/fail2ban.log | 7 days |

**Metrics:**
- Namespace: SmartFarm/SSH
- Memory usage tracking
- Disk usage tracking
- Collection interval: 60 seconds

**Files:**
- Configuration: `/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json`
- Logs: `/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log`

### 4. Security Status Dashboard

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Script:** `scripts/security-status.sh`

**Features:**
- Automated comprehensive security check
- Color-coded status indicators
- Real-time threat monitoring
- System resource monitoring
- One-command security audit

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/security-status.sh
```

**Output Includes:**
- fail2ban status and banned IPs

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Opening Port 22)

1. **AWS Security Group Update**
   ```
   Navigate to: AWS Lightsail → Networking → Firewall
   Rule: SSH (port 22) - Source: 0.0.0.0/0
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions Configuration**
   - SSH key stored in GitHub Secrets
   - Deployment workflow configured
   - Test deployment

### Recommended CloudWatch Alarms

Due to IAM permission limitations, these should be created manually via AWS Console:

1. **High Failed SSH Attempts**
   - Metric: SSHFailedLoginAttempts
   - Threshold: >10 in 5 minutes
   - Action: SNS notification

2. **Invalid User Attempts**
   - Metric: SSHInvalidUserAttempts
   - Threshold: >1 in 5 minutes
   - Action: SNS notification

3. **fail2ban Bans**
   - Metric: Fail2BanBans
   - Threshold: >3 in 15 minutes
   - Action: SNS notification

### Required IAM Permissions

Add to `AmazonLightsailInstanceRole`:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "logs:CreateLogGroup",
    "logs:CreateLogStream",
    "logs:PutLogEvents",
    "logs:PutRetentionPolicy",
    "logs:PutMetricFilter",
    "cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:406682760020:log-group:/aws/ec2/smartfarm/*"
}
```

## Operational Procedures

### Daily Monitoring

```bash
# Quick security check
./scripts/security-status.sh

# Check for banned IPs
ssh -i ~/Downloads/smartfarm-key.pem ubuntu@98.87.30.163 \
  "sudo fail2ban-client status sshd"
```

### Weekly Review

```bash
# Review recent SSH activity
ssh -i ~/Downloads/smartfarm-key.pem ubuntu@98.87.30.163 \
  "sudo tail -100 /var/log/auth.log | grep ssh"

# Check CloudWatch agent health
ssh -i ~/Downloads/smartfarm-key.pem ubuntu@98.87.30.163 \
  "sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -a status -m ec2"
```

### Monthly Tasks

1. Review CloudWatch logs for patterns
2. Update fail2ban rules if needed
3. Verify backup procedures
4. Apply system security updates

### Emergency Procedures

**Unban an IP:**
```bash
ssh -i ~/Downloads/smartfarm-key.pem ubuntu@98.87.30.163 \
  "sudo fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <IP_ADDRESS>"
```

**Rollback SSH Config:**
```bash
ssh -i ~/Downloads/smartfarm-key.pem ubuntu@98.87.30.163 \
  "sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS /etc/ssh/sshd_config && \
   sudo sshd -t && \
   sudo systemctl restart ssh"
```

**Access if Locked Out:**
Use AWS Lightsail browser-based SSH console

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. fail2ban immediately started blocking malicious traffic
2. CloudWatch agent integrated smoothly
3. SSH hardening had no impact on legitimate access
4. Security dashboard provides instant visibility

### Challenges Encountered
1. IAM permissions limited CloudWatch alarm creation (manual setup required)

3. UsePrivilegeSeparation directive deprecated (removed from config)

### Recommendations
1. Create CloudWatch alarms via console (documented in report)
2. Schedule weekly security dashboard checks
3. Review fail2ban logs monthly for patterns
4. Consider adding SNS notifications to fail2ban events
